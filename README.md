This project aims to create a web interface that allows users to predict doctor consultation fees based on their input. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset obtained by scraping data from the Practo website using Selenium. With the use of Python Pandas, the scraped data was thoroughly cleaned & preprocessed for accurate predictions.

## Project Details üöß

This project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing purposes. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data analysis and visualization. Scikit-learn (sklearn) is employed for building the machine learning model. Flask, HTML, and CSS are used to build an interactive website.

The main objective is to predict doctor consultation fees based on the following attributes:

- `speciality_of_doctor`: Specialty of the doctor
- `degree_type`: Type of degree (e.g., MBBS, MD, BDS)
- `year_of_experience`: Total years of experience
- `Location`: Clinic location
- `city`: City of the clinic
- `dp_score`: Doctor-patient experience score
- `npv_`: Number of people's votes

## Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to develop a robust machine learning model and an interactive web application that can accurately predict doctor consultation fees based on various attributes. The goal is to create a tool that assists both patients and healthcare providers in estimating the consultation fees for medical professionals.

## Python Files üêç

### Data Extraction üåê
- The data extraction phase involves collecting raw doctor information from the online medical consultancy booking site Practo. This is achieved using the Jupyter Notebook `Scrapping code.ipynb`.

### Data Preprocessing üßπ
- In the preprocessing phase, data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and exploratory data analysis is performed. The Jupyter Notebook `Preprocessing_EDA.ipynb` includes the cleaning and visualization code.

### Machine Learning Modeling ü§ñ
- The machine learning model is built using Scikit-learn and is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `ML_Models.ipynb`. This model predicts the consultation fee for doctors based on the provided attributes.

## DATA üìä

### Raw Data üìÇ
- The collected data is stored in `raw_practo.csv`.

### Cleaned Data üßº
- The cleaned data is saved in `clean_practo.csv`.

- The dataset indicates that the three most prominent specialties among doctors are:
  - Dentist
  - Gynaecologist
  - Pediatrician

## Web Application üíª

The project includes an interactive web application developed with Flask. The application allows users to input values for `speciality_of_doctor`, `degree_type`, `year_of_experience`, `Location`, `city`, `dp_score`, and `npv_` to obtain a predicted consultation fee for doctors. The machine learning model, stored as `model.pkl`, is integrated into the web application.
